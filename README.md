- 👋 Hi, I’m <b>@DJC-Intrepid</b>
- 👀 I’m interested in personalising the experience and management of individual healthcare, home automation and streamlining the social experience to support people finding what they want (which, more often than not, already exists) rather than the onus being on providers to promote in every nook an cranny of the internet to find those people. 
- 🌱 I’m currently learning... <b><i>everything?!</b></i> All of my personal and professional endeavours of late seem to end up here, so I thought an account would be useful. Now what do I learn first?! 
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on nothing as such right now, unless someone is a willing coding Jedi to a willing novice...?
- 📫 How to reach me: DJC.Intrepid.GitHub@outlook.com

- <b>Thanks for reading!</b>
